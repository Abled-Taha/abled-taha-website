This Project has 4 parts to it
1) This Website
2) [Back-End API](https://github.com/Abled-Taha/contact-me-api-python)
3) MongoDB
4) [Android App](https://github.com/Abled-Taha/contact_me)

This website not only server as my BIO but aslo helps others who want to contact me by getting their Email Address and their subject and storing it in my Database.

All the Front-End is done in HTML & CSS, the Back-End is in Django(Python), the API is in Flask(Python), the Database is MongoDB, and the Android App is in Flutter.

The Android App provides me the functionality of reading and deleting read requests for contacting me but this same functionality is also provided to me by the Admin panel of this website.
